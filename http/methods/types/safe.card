Request methods are considered like that if their defined semantics are essentially read-only; i.e., the client does not request, and does not expect, any state change on the origin server as a result of applying this kind of method to a target resource. Likewise, reasonable use of this kind of method is not expected to cause any harm, loss of property, or unusual burden on the origin server.
